## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

Used **Sequential Thinking + Perplexity MCP** to research industry best practices and engineer an institutional-grade opportunity discovery prompt.

---

## 🔬 Research Process

### Step 1: Researched Professional Methods
**Query**: "What are industry-standard methods professional traders use to discover opportunities?"

**Key Findings**:
- Multi-vector discovery (catalyst + technical + microstructure + quantitative)
- Volume must be SUSTAINED 2-5 bars (not one-off spikes)
- Smart Money Concepts (liquidity grabs, break of structure)
- Risk/reward minimum 2:1 (prefer 3:1+)

### Step 2: Researched Specific Thresholds
**Query**: "What exact quantitative parameters do professionals use?"

**Key Findings**:
- Volume: 2-3x average, sustained 2-5 bars
- RSI: 70/30 levels
- MACD: 12, 26, 9 settings
- ATR: 1.5-2x normal range
- Liquidity: 500K-1M shares/day minimum
- Risk/Reward: 2:1 minimum (3:1+ preferred)

### Step 3: Researched Highest-Probability Catalysts
**Query**: "Which catalysts drive >5% intraday moves most reliably?"

**Key Findings**:
1. **FDA approvals**: "Near certain >5% moves on binary events" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
2. **Earnings surprises**: >5% beat/miss with guidance ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
3. **M&A announcements**: Instant double-digit moves ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
4. **Tier-1 analyst actions**: Goldman, Morgan Stanley, JPM ⭐⭐⭐⭐
5. **Timing**: First 30 seconds to 5 minutes captures alpha

## 🏗️ Engineered Prompt Structure

### 5-Layer Architecture:

**Layer 1: Market Regime Analysis**
- Fear & Greed Index (0-100)
- VIX and volatility environment
- Sector rotation trends TODAY

**Layer 2: Session Awareness**
- Opening Bell: Gap plays, earnings reactions
- Morning Momentum: Breakout confirmations
- Midday: Range plays, mean reversion
- Power Hour: High volume momentum

**Layer 3: Multi-Vector Discovery (4 Parallel Screens)**
1. **Catalyst Screening**: Earnings, FDA, M&A, analyst actions TODAY
2. **Technical Validation**: Volume 2-3x sustained, breakouts, relative strength
3. **Quantitative Filters**: Liquidity >500K, R/R >2:1, ATR >1.5x
4. **Market Microstructure**: Options flow, dark pools, short interest

**Layer 4: Sector Rotation**
- 8-sector rotation every 2 hours
- Primary + secondary sectors with specific catalysts
- Cross-sector diversification (3-4 other sectors)

**Layer 5: Professional Output Format**
```
SYMBOL ($price) | CATALYST: [Specific event TODAY] | 
TECHNICAL: [Entry, pattern] | VOLUME: Xx avg | 
STOP: $X | TARGET: $X | TIMEFRAME: Xh
```

## 🎯 Critical Quality Requirements

The prompt now ENFORCES:

✅ **Specific Catalysts**: Each opportunity MUST have catalyst happening TODAY
✅ **Sector Diversity**: Minimum 5 different sectors per scan
✅ **Volume Confirmation**: 2x+ average, SUSTAINED (not one-off spikes)
✅ **Hidden Gems**: Avoid obvious mega-caps, find real opportunities
✅ **Actionable Timeframes**: Focus on next 2-4 hours
✅ **No Repetition**: Explicitly instructs to avoid repeating same stocks

---

## 📈 Expected Results

### Before:
```
Every scan: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, AMZN (same 10 mega-caps)
Catalyst: "Technical setup" (vague)
```

### After:
```
9am (Tech): AVGO, MU, QCOM, INTC, AMAT
Catalyst: "AVGO beat earnings 8%, raised guidance"

11am (Finance): JPM, BAC, GS, MS, C
Catalyst: "JPM upgraded by Goldman, loan growth accelerating"

1pm (Healthcare): GILD, BMY, ABBV, LLY, REGN
Catalyst: "GILD FDA approval for new HIV treatment"
```

## 📚 Documentation Created

1. **INSTITUTIONAL_PROMPT_RESEARCH.md**: Full research findings and methodology
2. **PROMPT_ENGINEERING_COMPLETE.md**: This summary
3. **Updated ai_opportunity_finder.py**: Implemented institutional-grade prompt

---

## 🚀 Ready to Test

The system is now ready to discover opportunities using professional-grade methodology.

**To test**:
```bash
# Run the scanner with the new prompt
python backend/test_momentum_quick.py
```

**Expected improvements**:
- 50+ diverse opportunities across sectors (vs 10 repeated mega-caps)
- Specific catalysts for each opportunity (vs vague "technical setup")
- Professional risk management (clear stops/targets)
- Session-aware strategies
- Real-time validation (TODAY's news and data)
