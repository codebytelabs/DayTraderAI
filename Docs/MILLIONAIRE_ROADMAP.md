## 📈 The Math (Compound Interest is Magic)

### Conservative Path (18-24 months):

Month 12: $179,586 (+$79,586)
Month 18: $240,662 (+$140,662)
Month 24: $322,510 (+$222,510)

Continue to $1M: ~36 months total
```

### Moderate Path (12-18 months):
```
Starting: $100,000
Monthly Return: 10% (with options leverage)

Month 1:  $110,000 (+$10,000)
Month 6:  $177,156 (+$77,156)
Month 12: $313,843 (+$213,843)
Month 18: $555,992 (+$455,992)
Month 24: $984,745 (+$884,745) ← ALMOST THERE!

Hit $1M: ~24 months
```

### Aggressive Path (8-12 months):
```
Starting: $100,000
Monthly Return: 15% (options + news edge)

Month 1:  $115,000 (+$15,000)
Month 6:  $230,706 (+$130,706)
Month 12: $535,217 (+$435,217)
Month 18: $1,242,160 (+$1,142,160) ← MILLIONAIRE! 🎉
