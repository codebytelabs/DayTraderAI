## ⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

### 1. 🟡 SATS Position Size
- **Issue:** $31,613 position (22% of equity) is large
- **Risk:** Only 0.2% trailing stop is too tight
- **Suggestion:** Consider scaling out or widening stop

### 2. 🟡 Today's Realized Losses
- Lost ~$588 today despite positive unrealized P/L
- Some closed trades (META, GOOGL) were quick scalps that didn't work
- **Suggestion:** Reduce scalping frequency, let winners run longer

### 3. 🟡 Trade Frequency
- 17 trades today, many were quick in/out
- META had 8 trades alone (churning)
- **Suggestion:** Increase minimum hold time or signal strength threshold

---

## 💡 OPTIMIZATION SUGGESTIONS

### Immediate Actions (High Impact)
1. **Widen SATS stop** to 1.5% below current ($70.11) to avoid premature exit
2. **Reduce META/GOOGL scalping** - these quick trades are losing money
3. **Let winners run** - LLY at +5.4% could go higher, don't exit early

### Strategy Tweaks
1. **Increase minimum signal strength** from current threshold
2. **Add time-based filter** - no trades in first/last 15 min of day
3. **Reduce position size** for new entries during extreme fear (counterintuitive but reduces whipsaw)

### Risk Management Enhancements
1. **Portfolio heat limit** - max 3% of equity at risk at any time
2. **Correlation check** - avoid too many similar positions
3. **Sector diversification** - currently heavy in financials (DIA, PGR, PRU)

## 🚀 POTENTIAL

With current trajectory:
- **Weekly:** +4% average
- **Monthly:** +16-20% (compounded)
